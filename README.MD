# Java AssertJ Workshop

The main goal of this project is to guide you to use AssertJ in your unit tests.

Why should I use AssertJ?
* easy to use: you just need to add a dependency and static import in your test class to start using AssertJ.
* fluent: AssertJ helps you to diversify your assertions.
* Testing code is more readable
* auto-completion: AssertJ provides auto-completion in IDEs, So you don't need to remember all method names.

There are two projects:

## Contacts Microservice

Contains samples based on a common microservice structure.

## Sample PokeAPI client
